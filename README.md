# Final-project
Project Title: Automated Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins and Docker
1. Objective
The objective of this project is to implement an automated CI/CD pipeline that facilitates the continuous integration, testing, and deployment of a sample application. The pipeline leverages Jenkins for continuous integration, Docker for containerization, and Ansible for configuration management, with deployment to a cloud environment.

2. Project Overview
This project sets up a complete CI/CD pipeline from scratch, automating the building, testing, and deployment of a Dockerized application. Jenkins handles continuous integration, Docker standardizes the environment via containers, and Ansible automates deployment. Kubernetes may be optionally used for container orchestration.

3. Technologies Used
Jenkins: Automates build, test, and integration processes.
Docker: Containerizes the application for consistency across environments.
Ansible: Manages configuration and automates deployments.
Kubernetes (optional): Orchestrates Docker containers.
Cloud: AWS or GCP for deployment.
CI/CD Pipeline: Automates the workflow from code commit to cloud deployment.
